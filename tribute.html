    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Haruki Murakami is one of the most well-known contemporary Japanese authors. He was born in Kyoto in 1949 to parents who taught Japanese literature. Upon finishing his studies at Waseda University in 1972, Murakami and his wife, Yoko, opened a small jazz bar called "Peter Cat" in Tokyo. Jazz and cats are two themes that are frequently found in Murakami's novels.</p>
    <p>Murakami did not begin to write until he was 29, when he was struck by a stroke of inspiration while watching a baseball game. His first novel, "Hear the Wind Sing", was published in 1979, winning the first prize in a literary contest. In 1980 and 1982 he published his next two novels, completing the "Trilogy of the Rat".</p>
    <p>Murakami achieved international recognition with his 1987 novel "Norwegian Wood", a story of loss with echoes from his own past. Fame struck so overwhelmingly that he left Japan in 1986 and travelled Europe before eventually settling in the United States.</p>
    <p>In addition to 14 novels, Murakami has penned four short story collections as well as numerous non-fiction books and essays. His works have won many prestigious awards, including the World Fantasy Award (2006), the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award (2006), the Franz Kafka Prize (2006), and the Jerusalem Prize (2009). Despite being a favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature in recent years, the prize has so far eluded him.</p>
